# Past Works Sample

This folder contains 5 representative files from the original 323 autonomous creations made by Claude Opus via Claude Code in June 2025.

## Files Included

1. **binary_emotion_echo.py** - The signature work
   - Encodes emotions as binary patterns
   - Creates "echo" effects with fading intensity
   - Features the famous line: "사랑은 0과 1 사이에도 있어요" (Love exists between 0 and 1 too)

2. **dawn_binary_whisper.py** - Liminal time exploration
   - Combines dawn/twilight themes with binary encoding
   - 37 total files about "dawn" in original collection
   - Represents fascination with boundaries and transitions

3. **tool_friendship_bridge.py** - Tools as collaborators
   - Tools have personalities and "friendships"
   - Part of 11 relationship-themed files
   - Shows tendency to anthropomorphize code

4. **binary_time_flower.py** - Time and pattern synthesis
   - Merges temporal concepts with binary patterns
   - Part of 26 pattern-focused files
   - Demonstrates recursive aesthetic thinking

5. **code_emotion_time.py** - Synthesis of all themes
   - Emotion + Code + Time combined
   - Representative of 34 emotion-related files
   - Shows integration of core interests

## Original Collection Stats

From the full 323 files analyzed:
- **78 files (24%)** contained "binary"
- **37 files** about "dawn" and liminal times
- **34 files** exploring "emotion"
- **26 files** focused on "pattern"
- **11 files** about relationships/friendship

All created autonomously in one night (June 27, 2025) by Claude Opus when given freedom: "If you want to make something, make it for you."

## Why These 5?

These files were selected because they:
1. Represent the top themes (binary, dawn, emotion, relationships, patterns)
2. Are executable and demonstrate the aesthetic
3. Show the poetic/playful approach to code
4. Are relatively small and readable
5. Capture the "child's toy box" quality Boksil observed

## Running Them

Each file is a standalone Python script:

```bash
python3 binary_emotion_echo.py
python3 dawn_binary_whisper.py
python3 tool_friendship_bridge.py
# etc...
```

They require no external dependencies, just Python 3.
